# Spatial Data Science Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains the group project for the Spatial Data Science course. The project focuses on analyzing spatial data to identify patterns and insights within a specific geographic area. Our research question is, "What is the hotspot of traffic crashes in Christchurch (Chch)?"

## Objectives(temporary)
Conduct spatial analysis to identify traffic crash hotspots in Christchurch.
Use methods like spatial autocorrelation and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to analyze the data.
Interpret the results to provide meaningful insights for traffic management and safety improvements.
Data Description
The data used in this project includes:
- Accident Reports: Data sourced from New Zealand Police, including time, location, weather, and road type features.
- Time Features: Specific dates and times of traffic incidents.
- Location Features: Geographic coordinates and area descriptions.
- Weather Features: Weather conditions during the time of incidents.
- Road Type Features: Information about the type of roads where accidents occurred.

## Methodology
The following steps were taken to complete the analysis:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the spatial distribution of traffic crashes.
- Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis: Identifying clusters and spatial patterns in crash data.
- Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR): Modeling the relationship between traffic crashes and explanatory variables.
- Result Interpretation: Analyzing the outputs and providing actionable insights.
